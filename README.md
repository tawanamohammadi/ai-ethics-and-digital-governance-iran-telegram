## 🧠 Abstract

This repository documents the complete research process, datasets, ethical framework, and AI-assisted analysis for the project:

> **“AI Ethics and Digital Governance in Iran and Telegram (2017–2025)”**

The research explores the intersection of **artificial intelligence ethics**, **digital governance**, and **platform censorship**, focusing on Telegram’s role in Iran’s information ecosystem.  
It investigates how algorithmic moderation, state control, and public trust intertwine — and how **ethical AI** and **data transparency** can empower digital rights and future policy design.

## 🎯 Research Objective

> **Main Goal:**  
> To create a transparent, reproducible framework that connects *AI ethics*, *platform governance*, and *digital rights* in the context of Iran’s evolving digital landscape between 2017–2025.

**Key Questions:**
1. How does Telegram censorship influence digital trust in Iran?  
2. What can AI ethics contribute to the understanding of platform governance?  
3. How can OSINT and AI collaboration improve data transparency in sensitive socio-political research?

## 🧮 Methodology Overview

- **OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence):**  
  Collected and verified Telegram, web, and public policy data using transparent pipelines.  

- **AI-Assisted Research:**  
  GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Grok-4 used for synthesis, comparative analysis, and documentation generation.  

- **Ethical & Governance Framework:**  
  Based on AI transparency principles (Accountability | Explainability | Human-in-the-Loop).  

- **Forecasting (2017 – 2025):**  
  Predictive modeling of public trust erosion under censorship and digital resilience strategies.
